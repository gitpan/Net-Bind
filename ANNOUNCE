The first release (0.01) of Net::Bind has been posted to CPAN under my
author id (KJOHNSON) and name (Kevin_Johnson).

Net::Bind provides a perl interfaces to various files related to the
bind DNS daemon.  For this alpha release, there is only an interface
for /etc/resolv.conf data.  Future releases will include interfaces
for named.boot files, zone files, bind dump files, and the new
named.conf file (ala bind-8.x).  I expect to provide these other
interfaces before it goes to beta release.

If you are interested in the future capabilities of this module,
please take a look at the current minimal implementation provide
feedback.

The module is in alpha release.  Think twice about using it to modify
important data.

The method interface is currently in an evaluation phase.  I expect to
make interface changes that are not backward compatible before it goes
to beta release.  I'm providing it now to get input on the interface.

The current version has been tested against 5.003_24.

Refer to the provided README file for additional information.

I am keenly interested in feedback from folks regarding the method
interface.  I want to make sure it's workable before I start chomping
on the other larger file interfaces.

Please report any bugs/suggestions to <kjj@pobox.com>.
